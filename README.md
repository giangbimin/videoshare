- Youtube Video Sharing App

- Using Ruby/Rails or a related Ruby framework. The application should include a real-time notification system to showcase the backend development skills.

## Key Features

- Sharing YouTube videos

- Viewing a list of shared videos (no need to display up/down votes)

- Real-time notifications for new video shares: When a user shares a new video, other logged-in users should receive a real-time notification about the newly shared video.
